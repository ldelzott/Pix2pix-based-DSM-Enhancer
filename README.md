# Pix2pix based DSM-enhancer

This repository hosts an image enhancement tool, based on a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). The GAN was trained on the altimetric data of the city of Bruxelles, from which thousands of samples were extracted: each sample contains several images of 256x256 pixels. One image contains low-quality altimetric data, another image contains higher-quality altimetric data, and a third image contains the NDVI view of the geographic region depicted by the first two images.

After the training process, the generator part of the GAN can be used to enhance the lower-quality altimetric data into higher-quality data. According to the results obtained for the data of Bruxelles, the model can learn the desired mapping for the training set: i.e. when a low-quality tile from the training set is given as an input, the GAN provides a (learned) enhanced version as an output. A visual inspection showed convincing generalization capabilities for the validation data. However, those performances could be largely influenced by the relative scarcity of the samples extracted from the considered dataset (Bruxelles). One could perform a proper evaluation of the generalization performances of the model by testing the model on a world region made of visual features distinct from those learned from Bruxelles.
